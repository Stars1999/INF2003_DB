# Health Management System

## Application Overview
This application is a web-based health management system with two primary user roles: **User (patients)** and **Doctor**. The system allows users to register, log in, track their health data, book appointments, and manage account settings. Doctors can manage patient health records, view and manage schedules, and update appointment statuses.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Check the installation with:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

- **Install required libraries:** Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install flask bcrypt cryptography matplotlib sqlite
    ```

### Setup Virtual Environment
To keep dependencies isolated, create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Database Setup
The application uses SQLite as its database engine. Ensure you have the database file INF2003_Proj_DB.db in the root folder of the application directory.

Create Database Tables: The script db_connection.py includes a function to initialize the database with necessary tables. Run:
bash
Copy code
python db_connection.py
This will create tables such as Users, User_History, Clinic_Schedule, Appointments, Medications, Medical_Cert, and user_health in INF2003_Proj_DB.db.
Running the Application
Start the Flask Server: Run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application: Open a web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
Application Configuration
Secret Key Setup
The secret key in app.py secures sessions and flash messages:

python
Copy code
app.secret_key = ‘your_secret_key’
Replace 'your_secret_key' with a unique secure key, e.g., generated by Python:

python
Copy code
import secrets
secrets.token_hex(16)
Update the generated key in app.py:

python
Copy code
app.secret_key = 'generated_secret_key'
Application Port and Debug Mode
By default, the application runs on port 5000 with debug mode enabled:

python
Copy code
app.run(debug=True)
Debug mode is useful during development but should be disabled in production for security:

python
Copy code
app.run(debug=False)
Application Features and Usage
User Registration:

On the main page, click Register to create an account.
Complete the registration form with:
Username
Password (encrypted and stored securely)
Email
Phone Number
Address
Click Submit to create the account. On successful registration, you’ll be redirected to the login page. If an error occurs (e.g., duplicate username), a message will be displayed.
Login:

On the main page, enter your Username and Password.
Click Login to access the appropriate dashboard (User or Doctor).
Incorrect credentials will display a login failure message.
User Dashboard:

As a regular user, the User Dashboard provides health data tracking and visualizations.
Features include:
Health Data Visualization: View blood pressure and blood sugar levels over time as bar charts (images saved in the static/images folder).
Health Data Submission: Users can submit new blood pressure and blood sugar data.
Doctor Dashboard:

Doctors have access to the Doctor Dashboard, which allows them to manage patient health records and schedules.
Key Features:
Patient Data Access: View patient health history, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and prescribed medications.
Appointment Schedule: Access upcoming appointments and manage clinic schedules.
Appointment Management:

Users can view available appointment slots and book a convenient time.
Booking:
Go to the Appointments page.
Select an available date and time slot and confirm.
Cancelling and Editing:
Users can cancel or edit existing appointments from their dashboard.
User Health Data Submission:

To log health metrics:
Go to the User Health section.
Enter Blood Pressure and Blood Sugar values.
Click Submit to save the data. The data is timestamped and stored in the user_health table.
Account Management:

Update account details, including Email, Phone Number, and Address in Settings.
Change Password: Enter a new password and confirm it to update securely.
Delete Account: Users can delete their accounts, which will remove all associated data.
Logout:

Click Logout to securely end your session.
Error Handling and Troubleshooting
Database Connection Errors: Ensure INF2003_Proj_DB.db is present in the application directory. Confirm successful connection messages in the terminal when running db_connection.py.

Debugging Mode: Debug mode (app.run(debug=True)) provides detailed error messages and line-by-line issues in the console, helping identify specific errors during development.

Session Issues: If encountering session errors (e.g., login problems), check that the secret_key in app.py is set securely.

Matplotlib Visualization Issues: Ensure matplotlib is installed and correctly imported. If visualizations don’t display correctly, verify the path to saved images (static/images/bpchart.png and static/images/bschart.png) in user_dashboard.html.

By following these detailed steps, you should be able to set up, configure, and run the application smoothly. Each feature and functionality is designed to offer a complete experience for both users and doctors while ensuring compatibility and proper configuration.
